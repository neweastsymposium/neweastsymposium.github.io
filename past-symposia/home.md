From 1999 to 2021, The Department of Slavic Languages & Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh held yearly Russian Film Symposia under the direction of Volodia Padunov. In the Spring of 2022, the Department adapted their Symposia under the title "New East Cinema," screening a selection of Ukrainian films in the wake of the February invasion. Posters for all of the Department's past Symposia have been archived and can be accessed by selecting the year in which they were held.
