<p>From 1999 to 2021, The Department of Slavic Languages & Literatures at the University of Pittsburgh held yearly
    Russian Film Symposia under the direction of Volodia Padunov. In the Spring of 2022, the Department adapted their Symposia 
    under the title "New East Cinema," screening a variety of Ukrainian films in the wake of the February invasion. Posters for 
    all past Symposia held by the Department are archived below.
